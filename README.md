just some more lua

## Disclaimer

This is just a repository where I'm implementing a few useful common datastructures
as an exercise along with other generally useful utility functions I often miss when writing lua.
So you may happily ignore this. 
The simplicity of Lua helps me focus on the core of those concepts while still provding practical use in my nvim plugin writing or dabblings in Löve2D.

Feel free to point out implementation flaws in the form of PR, given the purpose is a better understanding of these fundamental datastructures.

If you're looking for a more complete library, look at [batteries](https://github.com/1bardesign/batteries)

## Lua Version 5.1

All lua code is tested against Lua 5.1 since I use some parts in my nvim config and Löve2D dabblings.
